2015-09-08  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Prepare, tag, and publish 0.47 release.

	* configure.ac: Update copyright notice.
	(AC_INIT): Increment PACKAGE_VERSION assignment to 0.47

	* pexports.c: Update copyright notice.

	* README: Add release notes.
	* All files: Tagged "v0_47" for release.

2015-09-07  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Avoid uint32_t difference overflow in 64-bit pointer adjustment.

	* pexports.c (rva_to_ptr): Do not compute uint32_t offset differences;
	apply each offset adjustment individually to the base pointer.

	* pexports.h: Add '#pragma ms_struct on', to keep structures aligned
	per MSVC convention.

2015-09-07  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Eliminate Microsoft inspired obfuscated typedef insanity.

	* pexports.c pexports.h (BYTE, WORD, DWORD): Delete typedefs;
	respectively replace all corresponding usage instances with...
	(uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t): ...these ISO-C standard types.
	(PVOID, PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER, PIMAGE_FILE_HEADER, PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER)
	(PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, PIMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY, PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS32)
	(PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64, PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32)
	(PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64): Delete these non-standard style pointer
	reference typedefs; replace with conventional pointer references to
	the underlying data type; where these are structural types, delete
	initial underscores from the corresponding structure tag names.
	(HMODULE): Likewise; replace with pointer to void.

2013-05-30  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Prepare, tag, and publish 0.46 release.

	* README: Add release notes.
	* All files: Tagged "v0_46" for release.

2013-05-30  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Assemble licence and documentation tarballs for distribution.

	* Makefile.in (dist): Add dependencies on...
	(licdist, docdist): ...these new build goals; specify them based on...
	(LIC_DISTFILES, DOC_DISTFILES): ...these new macros; define them as
	the respective list of files to include in each tarball.

2013-05-29  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Force a remake, on package version updates.

	* Makefile.in (pexports.OBJEXT): Make it depend on Makefile; this
	indirectly captures changes, when configure.ac is updated.

2013-05-29  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Update program identification, via configuration process.

	* pexports.c (main): Update identification text; remove references...
	(VER_MAJOR, VER_MINOR): ...to these; combine them by substituting...
	(PACKAGE_VERSION_STRING): ...this new macro; also amend instructions
	for reporting bugs, as directed at URL identified by...
	(PACKAGE_BUG_REPORT): ...this additional new macro.

	* pexports.h (VER_MAJOR, VER_MINOR): Obsolete macros; delete them.

	* Makefile.in (PACKAGE_DEFS): New macro; defined in terms of these...
	(PACKAGE_VERSION_STRING, PACKAGE_BUG_REPORT_URL, PACKAGE_BUG_REPORT):
	...these additional new macros, defined by AC_SUBST from configure.ac,
	and subsequently propagated to pexports.c, as an addendum to...
	(CDEPFLAGS): ...this.

2013-05-29  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Autoconfiscate.

	* configure.ac Makefile.in: New files.
	* Makefile: Now auto-generated at configure time; remove it.
	* .hgignore: Add configure, Makefile, autom4te.cache and build dir.

2013-05-29  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Integrate build-aux utilities as a submodule.

	* .gitmodules .hgsub .hgsubstate: New files.

2013-05-28  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Designate files which mercurial should not track.

	* .hgignore: New file.

2013-05-28  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Correct some obfuscated typedef portability issues.

	* pexports.c: Include inttypes.h; it permits use of...
	(PRIdPTR): ...this ISO-C99 standard macro, in preference to...
	(INT_PTR_FORMAT): ...this non-standard contrivance; similarly...
	(intptr_t): ...substitute this ISO-C99 standard typedef...
	(INT_PTR): ...for this non-standard type.

	* pexports.h: Include stdint.h; typedef...
	(BYTE): ...this, as explicitly equivalent to uint8_t.
	(WORD): ...this, as explicitly equivalent to uint16_t.
	(DWORD): ...this, as explicitly equivalent to uint32_t.
	(INT_PTR, INT_PTR_FORMAT): No longer required; delete them.
	(ULONGLONG): Explicitly typedef as equivalent to uint64_t; although
	'unsigned long long' seems a better fit, our present usage requires
	the explicit 64-bit association, and use of this standard type allows
	us to eliminate all references to Microsoft's non-standard __int64.
	(LONG): Explicitly typedef as equivalent to int32_t; technically, this
	is incorrect, but misuse elsewhere requires the explicit 32-bit type,
	which is not guaranteed by ISO-C99's standard 'long' type.

2011-09-14  Daniel Collins  <solemnwarning@solemnwarning.net>

	Avoid segmentation faults in forwarder function checks.

	* pexports.h (dump_exports): Adjust prototype to accommodate new
	'exports_size' argument; this is to be assigned and passed from...
	* pexports.c (main): ...here; assigned value is determined from the
	export table size recorded in the PE file image, whence passed to...
	(dump_exports): ...here; it is used to avoid crashing or corruption
	when the export table isn't at the end of its section.  Also check
	for, and filter out duplicated symbol reports.

2009-09-15  Charles Wilson  <cwilso11@users.sourceforge.net>

	Slight build improvements.

	* README: Update.
	* Makefile: Rewrite dist rule to create a .tar.lzma instead
	of a .zip (and don't create a tarbomb). 

2009-09-15  Charles Wilson  <cwilso11@users.sourceforge.net>

	Package 0.44-1-mingw32 fixes.

	* pexports.c (main): Fix typo in usage statement.
	* pexports.h: Ensure ULONGLONG is defined.
	* Makefile: Force use of flex and bison, not lex and yacc.

	* hlex.l
	* hparse.y
	* pexports.h
	* pexports.c
	* str_tree.h
	* str_tree.c: Handle also 64-bit executables. Make it work also if
	built as 64-bit code. Remove all gcc -Wall warnings. Make it
	compilable also with MSVC. Disable Wow64 file system redirection
	when running as a 32-bit process on 64-bit Windows. Bump version
	to 0.44.
	* Makefile: New.
	* pe.h: Not needed, removed.
	* hparse.h: Remove generated file.
	* Makefile.am: Removed.

2002-11-08  Luke Dunstan  <infidel@users.sourceforge.net>

	* pexports.c (dump_exports): fix exports incorrectly
	determined to be forwarders.

1999-04-02  Paul Sokolovsky  <Paul.Sokolovsky@technologist.com>

	* pexports.c: now distinguishes data/non-data symbols,
	depending on type of section symbol in
	* pexports.c: in verbose mode prints section name for symbol
	* pexports.c: file offsets are now in hex

1998-11-07  Anders Norlander  <kv98anr@cs.umu.se>

	* hparse.y: types and parameters are now recognized as
	a series of tokens, which means that keywords like const
	struct and so on are not recognized as such, allowing any
	kind of parameter, including function pointers.

1998-11-05  Anders Norlander  <kv98anr@cs.umu.se>

	* hlex.l: removed all tokens except ID, CONST and VOLATILE

	* pexports.c: Separated printing to function dump_symbol
	* pexports.c: Fixed handling of forwarded exports

1998-10-26  Anders Norlander  <anorland@hem2.passagen.se>

	* New files: str_tree.c str_tree.h: implements
	a symbol tree.
	* pexports.c: changed symbol handling to use str_tree,
	add_function_prot removed.
	* pexports.h: removed add_function_prot prototype
	* hlex.l: removed unnecessary code (count, CONSTANT, STRING)
	* hlex.l: added ATTRIBUTE token.
	* hparse.y: completely rewritten. *Much* improved parser.
	* pexports.h: changed VER_MINOR to 3

1998-10-21  Anders Norlander  <anorland@hem2.passagen.se>

	* pexports.c: removed include_path structure and replaced
	it with a generic string list str_list.
	* pexports.c: preprocessor now defaults to "gcc -E -xc-header"
	instead of "cpp".
	* pexports.h: incremented minor version VER_MINOR to 2
	* pexports.c: headers are now parsed after all paramaters
	command line options have been parsed.
	* hparse.y: fixed problem with unnamed parameters that
	are pointers.
	* pexports.c: in dump_exports: don't print extra white
	space if ordinals are not supposed to be printed.
